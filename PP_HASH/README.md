# SHA-512

This segment contains hash algorithm SHA-512 and its better (faster implementation using Cellular Automaton). We have used the findings of J. Suganya and K. J. Jagadish Kumar, implementing Rule(N) instead of the overflow addition, which is computationally expensive and cryptographically less useful.

## Usage

Using this for test purpose :

1. The SHA-512 implementation :

```bash
$ ./hash [string]
```

for example:

```bash
$ ./hash abc

```

2. Cell-Automaton based implementation :

yet to implement
