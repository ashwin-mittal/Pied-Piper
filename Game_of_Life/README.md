# Cellular Automaton

Cellular Automaton is a concept that implements complex operations using elementary rules. The rules are even more basic than the bitwise operation and are in complexity around the level of boolean algebra.

## Use of Cellular Automata

Cellular Automaton is useful in the following but not limited to these domains :

1. Simulation of Biological Systems
2. Simulation of Dynamical Fluid Systems
3. Multi-Agent process simulation
4. Data Encryption
5. Data Compression
6. Digital Image, Digital Audio, and Video processing
7. Hashing Algorithms Optimization
8. Implementation as a Universal Computer

## Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is probably one of the earliest attempts to simulate a real-life looking process using cellular Automaton.
It is based on observing a `3x3` grid to decide the next state of a particular cell located centrally to the grid.
Now consider these basic rules :

1. If a cell has only 0 or 1 alive neighbor, it dies out of `ISOLATION.`
2. If a cell has two alive neighbors, it survives (if alive) `SURVIVAL.`
3. If a cell has three neighbors, then it becomes `ALIVE` if dead, `REPRODUCTION.`
4. If a cell has four or more neighbors alive, it dies of `CONGESTION.`

These rules looks easy but produce complex systems :

1. `OSCILLATOR` : Oscillator oscillates between 2 or more state. It has multiple variants. Some of them are shown below :

2. `Glider`: Glider is an agent capable of motion. It falls under a variant of spaceships.

3. `Glider Gun`; Glider Gun is an agent capable of producing Gliders for infinite time and survive itself as well.
