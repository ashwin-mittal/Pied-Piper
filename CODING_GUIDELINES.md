# Coding Guidelines

To maintain synchronized and efficient development, it is better if people follow a common coding standard.

## Code Modularity

1. Code should be written in modular functions to maximize reusability
2. All C and C++ codes that implement an algorithm should have a corresponding `.h` or `.hpp` file
3. Constants and Functions used in multiple files should be contained in separate `.h` files if they can be modified.

## Coding Style - Commands

1. Maintaining the legacy of PiedPiper of HBO, `tab` spaced codes are expected with `4` or `8` as the spacing size.
2. All functions and variables should have meaningful names and written in a proper way :

Functions :

```c
int getfactorsarray(){} // not recommended
```

```c
int getFactorsArray(){} // recommended
```

Variables :

```c
int numberoffactors = 0;    // not recommended
```

```c
int number_of_factors = 0; // recommended
```

Constants :

```c
const int maxarraysize = 1024;  // not recommended
```

```c
const int MAX_ARRAY_SIZE = 1024; // recommended
// or alternatively
#define MAX_ARRAY_SIZE 1024;
```

Comments :

Clarify the code as much as possible using comments for other developers to understand it.

```c
// one line comments (acceptable)
```

```c
// multiple
// line
// comments
// (unacceptable)
```

```c
/**
*  Multiple
*   lines
*   Comments (acceptable)
*/
```

## File System

The file-system / directory structure should be followed for making import statements easily.

1. All algorithms should be in separate folders
2. File-System tree :
