![Logo](piedpiper.jpeg)

# About

This is a project extension for the Algorithms course by team `Pied Piper.` Its main aim is :

1. Exploring the various concepts and implementing bottom-up, various compression, and encryption Algorithms.
2. Explore concepts of Cellular Automaton and implement a self-designed encryption engine using elementary Cellular Automaton.
3. Understand concepts like Cellular Automaton Transform, etc., that have huge potential for encryption and lossy data compression applications.
4. Implement Image compression algorithms like K-means, JPEG, PBIC.
5. Implement from scratch data compression and binary files compression algorithms like Huffman and Arithmetic Compression.
6. Produce analysis papers for the concepts learned and implemented.
